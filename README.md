# CyberSecurityProject1
Week 13 ELK stack project + previous week scripts.

This project contains a collection of Linux Scripts and Ansible Scripts I created in my Cyber Security class.

Most of the scripts are used to configure cloud servers with different docker containers.

The final setup was 4 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jump box and a server running an ELK stack container.
